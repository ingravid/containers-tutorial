= Pushing an image to a public registry

So far you've been working with your container image locally. Now let's take it to a remote registry.

IMPORTANT: Before continue, you need to create an account at Docker Hub (if you haven't done yet). Just click here: https://hub.docker.com/

First you'll need to tag your image accordingly to your user name and the name you gave to your repository on Docker Hub:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker tag my-image:latest myusername/myrepository:my-image-name-in-the-repo
----

[TIP]
====
If you would like to not use docker.io by default, then prefix the image name with the other registry (Quay.io, for example):

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker tag my-image quay.io/myrepository/my-image
----

Also, if you build your image already using the tag, you won't need to do this step before pushing it. In our case it would be like this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker build -t myusername/myrepository:my-image-name-in-the-repo .
----

====

IMPORTANT: From this point, replace `myrepository` with the name of your own repository.

If you now run `docker images` you'll see something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
REPOSITORY                TAG                                    IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-image                  latest                                 a63dec174904        55 minutes ago      516MB
myusername/myrepository   my-image-name-in-the-repo              a63dec174904        55 minutes ago      516MB
----

It's now ready to be pushed. Before doing it, you just need to login into your Docker Hub account within your terminal:

[.console-input]  
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker login
----

And finally you can push it:

[.console-input]  
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker push myusername/myrepository:my-image-name-in-the-repo
----

You should have an output like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
The push refers to repository [docker.io/myusername/myrepository]

----

Now if you go to your Docker Hub account (https://hub.docker.com) you'll see your image right there.
